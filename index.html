											<h2>Pap Test</h2>
										</header>
                                        <p>A Pap smear, also called a Pap test, is a screening procedure for cervical cancer. It tests for the presence of precancerous or cancerous cells on the cervix.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>Who needs to get a pap smear?</b><br>
                                        People like you and me. Anyone who has a cervix who has been sexually active for over three years and is older than 25 years of age should be screened for cervical cancer. The way that cervical cancer screening is currently done in BC is with a pap smear.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>What causes abnormal cells on a pap smear?</b><br>
                                        Abnormal cells are caused by an infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV) that your body’s immune system is unable to clear by itself.</p>

                                        <p><b>If I have abnormal cells on my cervix does it mean I have cervical cancer?</b><br>
                                        No. The vast majority of women who have abnormal cells found on a pap smear do NOT have cervical cancer. About 5% of women with abnormal cells have pre-cancer (dysplasia) that will need treatment.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>Who gets infected by HPV?</b><br>
                                        Everyone. Well, almost. Over 80% of men and women will be infected by HPV at some point in their life. Most HPV infections are cleared by the body’s immune system within 24 months but when there is a persistent infection, HPV causes cells to become abnormal (pre-cancer).</p>

                                        <p><b>How is HPV spread?</b><br>
                                        HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection and is not ONLY spread by penetrative sexual intercourse but any kind of sexual touching.</p>

											<h2>Colposcopy</h2>
										</header>
                                        <p>While pap smears are used to SCREEN for cervical cancer, colposcopy is a DIAGNOSTIC test that involves a specialized gynecologist looking at the cervix with a microscope.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>What should I expect during the exam?</b><br>
                                        Your cervix will be examined with a similar speculum as you had for your initial pap smear. The gynecologist will use a microscope (called a colposcope) to take a close look at your cervix for any abnormal cells, the colposcope does NOT go inside the vagina. Usually a small biopsy (1-2mm) will be taken from the cervix in order to get a diagnosis.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>If I am pregnant should I wait until after I deliver to have colposcopy?</b><br>
                                        No. It is very important to attend colposcopy after an abnormal pap smear during pregnancy. Always let the colposcopist know you are pregnant and it will impact the type of biopsy you will need.</p>

                                        <p><b>How long will I have to wait for my appointment?</b><br>
                                        Depending on the reason you have been referred and the specific findings noted on your pap smear you will be see within four weeks to 3 months time.  Less severe changes on your pap mean you may be seen closer to the 3-month time frame.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>Can I have colposcopy if I have my period?</b><br>
                                        If you are having moderate or light bleeding, colposcopy can still be performed however if you are passing large clots or having heavy bleeding it can be difficult to see the cervix with the microscope.</p>

                                        <p><b>Can I have sex after my colposcopy exam?</b><br>
                                        Not for 5 days. If you have had a biopsy of the cervix penetrative vaginal intercourse is not recommended for 5 days. You might have some bleeding after the biopsy for but it should not be heavier than a period. You may have some coffee-grounds coloured vaginal discharge depending on what the gynecologist puts on the biopsy site.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>What happens if the biopsy is positive?</b><br>
                                        If you have a biopsy that shows low-grade abnormal cells or you are under 25 years of age usually you will be followed closely either with pap smears or a follow-up coloposcopy in 6 months. If your biopsy shows high-grade abnormal cells (pre-cancer) you will be booked for treatment at a follow-up appointment in the colposcopy clinic.</p>

											<h2>Treatment</h2>
										</header>
                                        <p>If a colposcopy finds abnormal cells in your cervix, treatment to remove these cells may be recommended. The aim of treatment is to remove the abnormal cells while minimising damage to healthy tissue. Usually an area about the size of a fingertip is removed.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>What happens if I don’t get treatment?</b><br>
                                        Not all women with abnormal cells/pre-cancer of the cervix need treatment, for example, young women with mildly abnormal cells (low grade dysplasia).  However, women who have severely abnormal cells (high grade dysplasia) are at risk of these pre-cancer changes becoming cancer. Unfortunately there is no way of predicting which women with severely abnormal cells will go onto develop cancer and which women will not. We know that left untreated the risk of developing cancer increases over time. Thus we recommend treating all lesions that have a significant risk of becoming a cancer.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>What are the options for treatment?</b><br>
                                        Treatment of abnormal cells on the cervix (cervical dysplasia) involves destroying and or removing the abnormal cells in the cervix. The most common treatment is a Loop Electrical Excisional Procedure (LEEP). This procedure can be done in the Colposcopy clinic. The doctor performs a colposcopy to visualize the cervix, and then uses a very small needle to inject local anesthetic into the cervix to numb the area. Once the cervix is numb, a thin wire electrical loop is used to remove a small part of the cervix. The procedure takes about 10 minutes and you go home after the procedure. <br><br>
                                        
                                        Other treatments include:<br>
                                        Laser treatment of the cervix: The doctor uses a laser to destroy or burn away the abnormal cells of the cervix. This procedure is usually done in the clinic under local anaesthetic and again you go home after the procedure. <br><br>
                                        
                                        Cone biopsy of the cervix: In this case the abnormal area of the cervix is removed with a scalpel. This minor operation is usually done in the operating room and the patient may be under a general anaesthetic. (In rare cases, the doctor may recommend a total hysterectomy. In this case the cervix and the womb/uterus are removed. This is a longer operation and is done in the hospital usually under a general anaesthetic.) <br><br>
                                        
                                        If you are pregnant, then the treatment will be deferred until after you have had your baby. The doctor may want to see you in the colposcopy clinic during your pregnancy to monitor the cervix.</p>

                                        <p><b>How successful is treatment?</b><br>
                                        The success rate of these treatments are >90%. That means >90% of the time the cervical dysplasia is removed and there is no evidence of dysplasia at the follow up visit after the treatment. If there is evidence of abnormal cells on the cervix you may require further treatment.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>What should I expect after treatment?</b><br>
                                        Most people feel physically fine after their treatment. Some however will feel unwell and need to go home and lie down. It’s a good idea to have someone with you on the day of the treatment that can accompany or drive you home. You may have cramps for the rest of the day. Plain Tylenol or Ibuprofen can help to relieve any discomfort. You may have light vaginal bleeding or a watery discharge for several weeks. In some cases, after the treatment the doctor may place a tampon or dressing (pack) in your vagina to place pressure against the cervix and help stop any bleeding. You will be advised as to when to remove this dressing. <br><br>
                                        
                                        After your treatment you should avoid:<br>
                                        - Heavy exercise for the first 2 weeks <br>
                                        - Using tampons for 4 weeks <br>
                                        - Having penetrative sexual activity for 4 weeks <br>
                                        - You should be fully recovered 6 weeks after the treatment <br>
                                        
                                        
                                        </p>

                                        <p><b>Are there symptoms I should be concerned about?</b><br>
                                        There is a small risk (<5%) of developing a cervical infection or bleeding after the procedure. <br><br>
                                        
                                        Call your doctor if: <br>
                                        - You have vaginal discharge that begins to smell bad <br>
                                        - You have a fever <br>
                                        - You have vaginal bleeding that is heavy. If the bleeding is very heavy (soaking through a regular sanitary pad every hour) you should go to your closest Emergency Room. <br>
                                        - You have increasing pain in the abdomen or pelvis <br>
</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>What are the risks?</b><br>
                                        There are some long-term risks to your health associated with a cervical treatment. Rarely the treatment can cause narrowing of the entrance of the cervix (cervical stenosis) this may interfere with menstruation or ability to get pregnant (very rare).  Some studies have found that after a woman has had a LEEP she may have a slightly increased risk of delivering a baby early.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>What is the follow up?</b><br>
                                        Usually your first follow up appointment will be 6 months after your treatment. You will be seen in the Colposcopy Clinic for another colposcopy. The doctor will examine your cervix using the colposcope. They will take a biopsy of any abnormal looking area. <br><br>
                                        The gynecologist will also test for the presence of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). If there are no abnormal cells and the test for the HPV virus is negative, it is highly likely that the treatment has been successful. You will then be discharged from the clinic with a recommendation to return to your family doctor or nurse practitioner for ongoing pap smear screening. <br><br>
                                        The gynecologist in the Colposcopy Clinic may want to follow you for longer in the Colposcopy Clinic. In that case you will not need to see your family doctor or nurse practitioner for pap smear screening as long as you are attending your appointments in the Colposcopy Clinic.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>What are the risks?</b><br>
                                        There are some long-term risks to your health associated with a cervical treatment. Rarely the treatment can cause narrowing of the entrance of the cervix (cervical stenosis) this may interfere with menstruation or ability to get pregnant (very rare).  Some studies have found that after a woman has had a LEEP she may have a slightly increased risk of delivering a baby early.</p>
